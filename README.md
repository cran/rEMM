Implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships between Clusters for Data
Streams), a generalization of Extensible Markov Model (EMM), to model
transition probabilities in sequence data. TRACDS adds a temporal or
order model to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically
adapting Markov Chain. Also provides an implementation of EMM (TRACDS on
top of tNN data stream clustering).

## Installation

**Stable CRAN version:** install from within R with

``` r
install.packages("rEMM")
```

**Current development version:** Install from
[r-universe.](https://mhahsler.r-universe.dev/ui#package:rEMM)

## Usage

We use a artificial dataset with a mixture of four clusters components.
Points are generated using a fixed sequence \<1,2,1,3,4\> through the
four clusters. The lines below indicate the sequence.

``` r
library(rEMM)

data("EMMsim")

plot(EMMsim_train, pch = EMMsim_sequence_train)
lines(EMMsim_train, col = "gray")
```

EMM recovers the components and the sequence information. We use EMM and
then recluster the found structure assuming that we know that there are
4 components. The graph below represents a Markov model of the found
sequence.

``` r
emm <- EMM(threshold = 0.1, measure = "euclidean")
build(emm, EMMsim_train)
emmc <- recluster_hclust(emm, k = 4, method = "average")
plot(emmc)
```

![](inst/README_files/example_model-1.png)<!-- -->

We can now score new sequences (we use a test sequence created in the
same way as the training data) by calculating the product the transition
probabilities in the model. The high score indicates this.

``` r
score(emmc, EMMsim_test)
```
