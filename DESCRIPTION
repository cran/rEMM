Description: Implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships 
    between Clusters for Data Streams), a generalization of 
    Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order model
    to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting
    Markov Chain. Also provides an implementation of EMM (TRACDS on top of tNN 
    data stream clustering). Development of this 
    package was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893 and R21HG005912 from 
    the National Human Genome Research Institute. Hahsler and Dunham (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v035.i05>.
