  volume = {18},
  pages = {77--82},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Sequence clustering replaces groups of similar sequences
	in a database with single representatives. Clustering large protein
	databases like the NCBI Non-Redundant database (NR) using even the
	best currently available clustering algorithms is very time-consuming
	and only practical at relatively high sequence identity thresholds.
	Our previous program, CD-HI, clustered NR at 90\% identity in approximately
	1 h and at 75\% identity in approximately 1 day on a 1 GHz Linux
	PC (Li et al., Bioinformatics, 17, 282, 2001); however even faster
	clustering speed is needed because the size of protein databases
	are rapidly growing and many applications desire a lower attainable
	thresholds. RESULTS: For our previous algorithm (CD-HI), we have
	employed short-word filters to speed up the clustering. In this paper,
	we show that tolerating some redundancy makes for more efficient
	use of these short-word filters and increases the program's speed
	100 times. Our new program implements this technique and clusters
	NR at 70\% identity within 2 h, and at 50\% identity in approximately

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alignment-free sequence comparison methods are still in
	the early stages of development compared to those of alignment-based
	sequence analysis. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic measure
	of similarity between two biological sequences without alignment.
	The method is based on the concept of comparing the similarity/dissimilarity
	between two constructed Markov models. RESULTS: The method was tested
	against six DNA sequences, which are the thrA, thrB and thrC genes
	of the threonine operons from Escherichia coli K-12 and from Shigella
	flexneri; and one random sequence having the same base composition
	as thrA from E.coli. These results were compared with those obtained
	from CLUSTAL W algorithm (alignment-based) and the chaos game representation
	(alignment-free). The method was further tested against a more complex
	set of 40 DNA sequences and compared with other existing sequence
	similarity measures (alignment-free). AVAILABILITY: All datasets
	and computer codes written in MATLAB are available upon request from
	the first author.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic recombination and, in particular, genetic shuffling
	are at odds with sequence comparison by alignment, which assumes
	conservation of contiguity between homologous segments. A variety
	of theoretical foundations are being used to derive alignment-free
	methods that overcome this limitation. The formulation of alternative
	metrics for dissimilarity between sequences and their algorithmic
	implementations are reviewed. RESULTS: The overwhelming majority
	of work on alignment-free sequence has taken place in the past two
	decades, with most reports published in the past 5 years. Two main
	categories of methods have been proposed-methods based on word (oligomer)
	frequency, and methods that do not require resolving the sequence
	with fixed word length segments. The first category is based on the
	statistics of word frequency, on the distances defined in a Cartesian
	space defined by the frequency vectors, and on the information content
	of frequency distribution. The second category includes the use of
	Kolmogorov complexity and Chaos Theory. Despite their low visibility,
	alignment-free metrics are in fact already widely used as pre-selection
	filters for alignment-based querying of large applications. Recent
	work is furthering their usage as a scale-independent methodology
	that is capable of recognizing homology when loss of contiguity is
	beyond the possibility of alignment. Availability: Most of the alignment-free
	algorithms reviewed were implemented in MATLAB code and are available
	at http://bioinformatics.musc.edu/resources.html},

  abstract = {The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier, a naïve Bayesian
	classifier, can rapidly and accurately classify bacterial 16S rRNA
	sequences into the new higher-order taxonomy proposed in Bergey's
	Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (2nd ed., release 5.0, Springer-Verlag,
	New York, NY, 2004). It provides taxonomic assignments from domain
	to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority
	of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence (> or
	= 95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with
	the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline,
	the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences
	as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy.
	The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that
	the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length
	and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level,
	and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to
	anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such
	as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate
	varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments
	around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates.
	The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA
	sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences.
	Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate
	microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries.
	It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa
	differentially represented between samples. The RDP Classifier and
	RDP Library Compare are available online at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/.},
